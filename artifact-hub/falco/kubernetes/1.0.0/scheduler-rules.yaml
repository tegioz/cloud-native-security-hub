# Auto-generated set of falco rules for kube_scheduler containers
# Generated at 2018-05-23 09:58:49 UTC

# By default, the autogenerated rules include rules that attempt to
# restrict the set of system calls that can be performed by
# applications. However, we know that these rules are fairly FP-prone,
# so they are disabled by default. If you'd like to enable them,
# either change or override this macro's condition to "evt.num >= 0".
- macro: kube_scheduler_consider_syscalls
  condition: (evt.num < 0)

# These policies are limited to containers, specifically those where
# the container image name starts with "kube_scheduler"
- macro: app_kube_scheduler
  condition: container and container.image contains "kube-scheduler"
