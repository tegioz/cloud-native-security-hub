# Auto-generated set of falco rules for event_exporter containers
# Generated at 2018-05-23 15:00:05 UTC

# By default, the autogenerated rules include rules that attempt to
# restrict the set of system calls that can be performed by
# applications. However, we know that these rules are fairly FP-prone,
# so they are disabled by default. If you'd like to enable them,
# either change or override this macro's condition to "evt.num >= 0".
- macro: event_exporter_consider_syscalls
  condition: (evt.num < 0)

# These policies are limited to containers, specifically those where
# the container image name starts with "event_exporter"
- macro: app_event_exporter
  condition: container and container.image startswith "event_exporter"

# Not considering all inbound networking suspect

# Not considering all outbound networking suspect

# Restricting listening ports to selected set

- list: event_exporter_allowed_inbound_ports_tcp
  items: [80]

- rule: Unexpected inbound tcp connection event_exporter
  desc: Detect inbound traffic to event_exporter using tcp on a port outside of expected set
  condition: inbound and evt.rawres >= 0 and not fd.sport in (event_exporter_allowed_inbound_ports_tcp) and app_event_exporter
  output: Inbound network connection to event_exporter on unexpected port (command=%proc.cmdline pid=%proc.pid connection=%fd.name sport=%fd.sport user=%user.name %container.info image=%container.image)

# Restricting spawned processes to selected set

- list: event_exporter_allowed_processes

- rule: Unexpected spawned process event_exporter
  desc: Detect a process started in a event_exporter container outside of an expected set
  condition: spawned_process and not proc.name in (event_exporter_allowed_processes) and app_event_exporter
  output: Unexpected process spawned in event_exporter container (command=%proc.cmdline pid=%proc.pid user=%user.name %container.info image=%container.image)

# Restricting files read or written to specific set

- list: event_exporter_allowed_file_prefixes_readonly
  items: ["/proc"]

- rule: Unexpected file access readonly for event_exporter
  desc: Detect an attempt to access a file readonly other than below an expected list of directories
  condition: (open_read and evt.is_open_write=false) and not fd.name pmatch (event_exporter_allowed_file_prefixes_readonly) and app_event_exporter
