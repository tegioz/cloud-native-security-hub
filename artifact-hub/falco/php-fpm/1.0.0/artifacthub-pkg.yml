  # PHP-FPM Falco Rules

  PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation with some additional features useful for sites of any size, especially busier sites.

  These features include:
  - Adaptive process spawning
  - Basic statistics (ala Apache's mod_status)
  - Advanced process management with graceful stop/start
  - Ability to start workers with different uid/gid/chroot/environment and different php.ini (replaces safe_mode)
  - Stdout & stderr logging
  - Emergency restart in case of accidental opcode cache destruction
  - Accelerated upload support
  - Support for a "slowlog"
  - Enhancements to FastCGI, such as fastcgi_finish_request() - a special function to finish request & flush all data while continuing to do something time-consuming (video converting, stats processing, etc.)

  ... and much more.
